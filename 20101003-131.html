<p> My Name is Eman Zafar. I am studying VSS in 7th semester. It is a great subjet to be learn. VSS eliminates the need for protocols like HSRP (Hot Standby Routing Protocol) or VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), which are generally put in place to help with redundancy. These protocols still require each switch to have its own control plane, which is where VSS is more optimal.Visual snow is a form of sensory disturbance in which an individual continuously perceives small dots throughout their visual field. This phenomenon was first described in 1995 but has only been characterized in detail in the past few years.</p>
